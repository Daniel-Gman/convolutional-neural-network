# Convolutional Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) script designed to recognize handwritten numbers from 28x28 pixel images. The primary objective is to serve as a learning resource to understand the steps, logic, and mathematics behind building a neural network.

The script is thoroughly commented to explain each line, detailing what the line does, how it works in Python, and the mathematics behind it (primarily linear algebra). This repository aims to help those interested in learning the fundamentals of deep learning, with a focus on convolutional neural networks.

## üß† **Learning Focus**

I did not write the core code for this project but took responsibility for understanding every step of the process. The comments in `nn.py` provide detailed explanations of how the CNN works, both logically and mathematically. This includes an introduction to topics like:

- **Neural network layers** and their operations.
- **Convolutions** and their role in feature extraction.
- **Error handling** See how the network checks itself for errors.
- **Backpropagation and loss functions** used to optimize the model.
  
I highly recommend reading through the comments to gain insights into the steps and logic behind CNNs.

## üåü **Personal Goals** üåü

My learning journey does not stop with understanding this CNN model. I have set myself the following goals to achieve by **February 2025**:

### 1. **Object Detection Model (with tutorial)**
   - **Goal**: Create an object detection model that can scan images for specific objects, following a tutorial for guidance.
   - **Learning Focus**: Understanding how object detection differs from image classification, working with bounding boxes, and exploring pre-trained models like YOLO.

### 2. **Object Detection Model (from scratch)**
   - **Goal**: Build an object detection model from the ground up using **Jupyter Notebook**, without any help from tutorials.
   - **Learning Focus**: Implementing object detection algorithms independently, coding from scratch, and deepening my understanding of the full process.

### 3. **Develop DVOD (Daniel Vermeulen Object Detection)**
   - **Goal**: Improve the object detection model to function like **YOLOv8**, but enhance it with my own innovations. This will be the beginning of **DVOD**.
   - **Learning Focus**: Learning advanced techniques in object detection and applying my own ideas to create a custom object detection framework.

The diagram above represents the CNN architecture used in the model. The architecture consists of:

- **Input Layer**: 28x28 pixel images (grayscale).
- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to extract features.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining key features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Convert the features into final predictions.

## üîç **What's Next?**

If you're interested in following my journey or contributing to this project, feel free to check back as I will create more repositories with new object detection models and improvements.

- **Feedback**: I'd love to hear from you. Open an issue or drop a message!

Stay tuned for updates as I work towards building and improving my own object detection models!
